Required methods for current solutions in "tournamentFileFormat.txt"

Writers:

X    - Check if file with same name already exists(String tournament name shortened), boolean
    // Create 3 files for each folder (upcoming,...) and check if they already exists

X    - Write tournament without teams to file(---All tournaments attributes---)
    //Check if description is empty. If empty, add "No description".
    //Throw exception if file can't be written to.
    //Don't check if there is a duplicate here, since this method is first used when creating a tournament,
    which already checks for duplicates independently. We then want to use this method for editing
    tournaments later when there still are no teams added, which means it should overwrite the tournament file
    but maybe not the overview.

X    - Write tournament to overview file (String tournament name shortened, File file), void
    //Method writes the tournaments name into an overview file.
    //Uses the file path to figure out if it is upcoming, ongoing or previous).

    - Edit Tournament amd write back to file while removing old file(---All tournament attributes---)
    //removed past file under same name, then writes a new one
    //also removes file from either overview.

Readers:

    - Read Through Ongoing Tournaments, ArrayList<String>
    - Read Through Upcoming Tournaments, ArrayList<String>
    - Read Through Previous Tournaments, ArrayList<String>
    //Can be used for getting file paths for each ongoing/upcoming/previous tournaments.
    //Easy as ongoing tournament always have the same file path, unless it's been changed by someone

    - Read tournament file and return arraylist of tournament properties, ArrayList<String>
    //
